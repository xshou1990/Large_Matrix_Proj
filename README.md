This is final class project for CSCI 6971/4971 Large Scale Matrix Computations and Machine Learning, Spring 2019,
taught by Prof. Alex Gittens.

Briefly the goal is to review a paper and run experiments to better understand the paper and its methods.

In this ADAGRAD paper, J. Duchi proposed the ADAGRAD family of algorithms, which later became the "ancestor" of the very popular ADAM.

I wrote the codes to compare these methods with traditional SGD and (L)BFGS. My presentation slides are included.
